Interests & Experience

For the last twelve years I have worked with dozens of companies in the 
Twin Cities area (see last page for consulting projects) on a wide array 
of web and non-web projects. I've spent the majority of this time 
working in Java but I have also worked in several other languages 
including CoffeeScript, C#, Cold Fusion, PHP, ASP , ActionScript, VB, 
XSL and many more.   
  
I consider myself a â€œfull stackâ€ developer; I have built many projects 
from the ground up (from server install to initial database design to 
back and front end implementation). I primarily use VIM for development 
and my distro of choice is crunchbang. The technologies I am most 
interested at the time are nodejs, redis, coffeescript, nginx, groovy 
and grails.  
  
My ideal position would include 25% development time and 75% 
management/leadership. I have experience managing up to five developers 
(not including offshore) and would be interested in extending this 
experience farther.
